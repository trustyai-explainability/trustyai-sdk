= TrustyAI SDK
:navtitle: Overview

The TrustyAI SDK is a Python toolkit for testing machine learning models. You can run tests locally on your computer or on Kubernetes clusters.

== Key Features

* **Multiple Testing Tools**: Works with LM Evaluation Harness, RAGAS, and other testing tools
* **Run Anywhere**: Test models on your computer or scale up using Kubernetes
* **Works with TrustyAI**: Built to work with TrustyAI Operator and OpenDataHub
* **Easy to Use**: Command line tools and Python code for different workflows
* **Safety Checks**: Checks your setup before running tests

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Install the SDK
pip install trustyai[eval]

# Run a local evaluation
trustyai eval execute \
  --provider lm-eval-harness \
  --execution-mode local \
  --model "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium" \
  --tasks "hellaswag,arc_easy" \
  --limit 10

# Deploy to Kubernetes
trustyai eval execute \
  --provider lm-eval-harness \
  --execution-mode kubernetes \
  --model "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium" \
  --tasks "hellaswag,arc_easy" \
  --namespace trustyai-eval \
  --cpu 4 \
  --memory 8Gi \
  --limit 50

== How It Works

The TrustyAI SDK has several main parts:

Provider System:: Different testing tools that work with various testing frameworks
Execution Modes:: Run tests on your computer or spread them across Kubernetes
Validation Framework:: Checks your setup before running tests to avoid problems
Kubernetes Integration:: Works directly with TrustyAI Custom Resources and the TrustyAI Operator

== What You Can Use It For

* **Test Language Models**: Run standard tests on language models
* **Check Production Models**: Keep testing models that are running in production
* **Research Work**: Build flexible testing workflows for ML research
* **Team Workflows**: Set up testing that scales with Kubernetes
